## Team-Profile


## Description:
It dynamically generates a readme, based on user input. The finished look is professional, and gives a really good standard template for a good readme. The app works by running through Node, prompting the user of different questions that are linked to the format of the READ.me that will be generated. Each question relates to a header, and anything written by the user will be added underneath the associated title. This allows users to simply add the content and then the app generates a professional READ.me. If a user looks at the code or wanted to modify the code, the index contains the main function making the app work, and the other content is modulated into seperate JS files.

## Installation:
Simply download and open in VS code.
Install NPM jest and NPM Inquirer

## Usage:
Run the questions.js file in an intergrated terminal through VScode and then follow the prompts
